## 🎯 Purpose of This Repository

- Build **strong Python foundations** for Machine Learning
- Practice **real data handling**, not toy examples
- Prepare for:
  - Core Machine Learning algorithms
  - Deep Learning with PyTorch
  - End-to-end ML projects

This repository acts as a **base layer** before moving into:
- Scikit-learn models
- ML pipelines
- Neural networks
- Deployment projects

---

## 🚀 Next Steps
- Implement classical ML algorithms using scikit-learn
- Perform EDA on real-world datasets
- Build end-to-end ML projects
- Add project-specific repositories

---

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
- Python
- NumPy
- Pandas
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
- Jupyter Notebook

---

## 📌 Note
This repository is part of a **structured ML learning roadmap**, focused on projects and job-readiness rather than certificates.
